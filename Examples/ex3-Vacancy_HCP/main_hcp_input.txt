This example shows the vacancy diffusion in a non-Bravais 3D crystal, the hexagonal-compact or HCP crystal.
The main difference with example 1 is that we are using the keyword BASIS to define non-Bravais crystals.

& CRYSTAL hcp
+1.0 +0.0 +0.0
-0.5 sqrt(3)/2 +0.0
+0.0 +0.0 sqrt(8/3)
& BASIS s 2 # defines the number of basis atoms that are used to find valid symmetry operations for the system.
0 1/3 2/3 1/4 # the first number is a "type" of basis atom. Valid symmetry operations bring all basis atoms of a given type on atoms of the same type.
0 2/3 1/3 3/4
& UNIQUEPOS 1
s 1/3 2/3 1/4
& SPECIES 1 # for this exmaple we define only one species, a vacancy on substitutional sites
1 1 vacancy
& JUMPMECH # there are two jump types in the HCP lattice: basal and pyramidal
%% 1 pyramidal_jump
s 1 1/3 2/3 1/4 > 1 2/3 1/3 3/4
%% 1 basal_jump
s 1 1/3 2/3 1/4 > 1 4/3 2/3 1/4
& KINETICRANGE 1 # the value is not important for monomers (clusters with only one component)
