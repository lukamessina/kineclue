# Depending on the temperature and strain range, the Lvv coefficient might become negative
# It will switch to positive if the kinetic range is sufficiently increased
# Check the automatically plotted figure which provides transport coefficients as a function of strain and temperature
# Solid lines marks a change of sign, dashed lines are simply contour lines (2 orders of magnitude between each line)
# the case being treated here is that of a tracer atom diffusing with the vacancy
# the sensitivity study is also performed and correlation factors and mobility coefficients are output
