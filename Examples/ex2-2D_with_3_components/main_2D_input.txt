Another simple example on a 2-dimensional square lattice where vacancies occupy substistutional sites and solutes occupy interstitial sites.
We consider a cluster of 3 components (1 vacancy and 2 solutes)

& CRYSTAL square # 2-D crystal. Note that all z-components must be set to 0 in UNIQUEPOS and JUMPMECH keywords
1 0
0 1
& UNIQUEPOS 3 # we define two possible lattice sites that can be occupied by solutes and defects
o 0 0 0 # substitutional sites
o 0.5 0.5 0 # interstitial sites type 1
o 0.5 0.0 0 # interstitial sites type 2
& SPECIES 2
2 0 1 1 solute # there are 2 solutes; they cannot occupy the first position (substitutional site) but can occupy the second and third positions (interstitial sites) 
1 1 0 0 vacancy # there is 1 vacancy located on substituional sites only
& KINETICRANGE 2 1 # second number is the range of thermodynamic interaction (reduces computational load)
& JUMPMECH # we do not consider solute_vacancy exchanges in this example; each species diffuses on its own sublattice
