# Kinetic and thermodynamic range for cluster interactions. Definition of ThRa (ThRa < KiRa) is optional: it allows to reduce the amount of configurations and jump frequencies, while maintaining effective kinetic interactions up to KiRa. 
# Advisable to use a ThRa large enough to include the first shell outside the targeted thermodynamic interaction shell. All jumps leading to outside ThRa are grouped in the same jump frequency, regardless of the final position (for instance, if ThRa = 1nn, jumps w(1nn->2nn), w(1nn-3nn), and w(1nn-4nn) are grouped in the same jump frequency).

# Sublattices that can be occupied by cluster components
# Since OSA relax to the middle of the empty space when next to a vacancy, 
# define a sublattice marking the middle position between two nearest-neighbor sites. 
# This sublattice can be occupied only when vacancy and OSA are 1nn: 
# this is taken care of by the permissions in SPECIES,
# and by forbidding (0 prefactor) the substitutional 1nn configuration in the numerical input.
