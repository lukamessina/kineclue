# Main input file for migration of oversized solute atoms (OSA) in FCC crystals by the half-vacancy mechanism.
# In order to model the OSA mechanism correctly, the substitutional 1nn configuration (not relaxed) must be forbidden by setting its prefactor to zero, either in the configurations.txt file, or in the interaction file. In the latter case, the file should contain the following:
	& C o 2 1.32            # intermediate
 		vacancy  0.25 0.25 0.00
 		osa      0.25 0.25 0.00
	& C o 2 0.0 0.0         # 1nn to remove (first 0.0 is the prefactor, second 0.0 the binding energy)
 		vacancy  0.0 0.0 0.0
 		osa      0.0 0.5 0.5

# Prefactors (optional) and saddle energies (mandatory) for each reference jump mechanism defined in the main input (jump labels must match)
# For sol_2nn, sol_3nn, sol_5nn, initial and final configurations are not symmetrically equivalent. 
# By default, migration barriers are computed using the KRA approximation (Eq. 24 of the reference KineCLuE paper) 
# For instance in sol_2nn: actual migration barrier w(1nn->2nn) is 2.10 eV, Eb(1nn) = 1.32 eV, Eb(2nn) = -0.09 eV (repulsive). 
# The actual saddle-point energy with respect to Eb=0 is then E_sp = E_mig(1nn->2nn) - Eb(1nn) = 0.78 eV. 
# In order to obtain this saddle-point energy, one needs to reverse eq. 24 to find Q_alfa = E_sp + ( Eb(1nn) + Eb(2nn) ) / 2 = 0.78 + ( 1.32 - 0.09 ) / 2 = 1.395 eV.
