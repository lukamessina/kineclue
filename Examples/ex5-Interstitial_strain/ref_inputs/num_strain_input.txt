# Num input file for migration of interstitial atoms (carbon) on octahedral positions in bcc crystal under shear strain, to compute elastodiffusion coefficient d44 = d(L_12)/d(eps_12), using a very small numerical strain.
# Derivative must be computed manually by taking values at eps = 0 and eps != 0

# Prefactors, saddle energy, and elastic dipoles (all in eV) for each reference jump mechanism defined in the main input (jump labels must match)
# In this case, migration energy of C interstitials in pure Fe.
# In strain calculations, strain can produce extra jump mechanisms due to broken symmetry. To be checked by looking at the automatically written input_main_strained.txt file, and including all found jump mechanisms here under, applying as well the proper symmetry operation to the elastic dipole matrix.
