# Main input file for migration of interstitial atoms (carbon) on octahedral positions in bcc crystal under shear strain, to compute elastodiffusion coefficient d44 = d(L_12)/d(eps_12).
# L_12 is transport coefficient for diffusion along 'x', due to driving force along 'y' (and viceversa). eps_12 is an elementary shear strain.
# In order to compute anisotropic diffusion terms such as L_12, use NORMAL keyword.
