# Main input file for migration of a <110> dumbbell-solute pair in BCC crystals, including several migration mechanisms (rotation-translation, pure translation, onsite rotation). The last two mechanisms can be removed if user wants to include rotation-translation jumps only.

# Sublattices that can be occupied by cluster components
# The dumbbell needs a special sublattice, defined by the substitutional site of its center plus its orientation with the help of the 'd' symbol, corresponding to the small displacement (offset) of one of the dumbbell atoms from the substitutional site. To describe the sublattice, only one of the two dumbbell atoms is needed (the other position is found by symmetry).    
# To define the dumbbell positions in UNIQUEPOS and JUMPMECH with the 'd' symbol, the most common math operations can be used (+, -, *, /, sqrt(), ** (power)  )

 1  1 -1 solute						# 1 solute species, that can occupy either a substitutional site, or the dumbbell sublattice to form a mixed dumbbell. But in the latter case, it can be there only when sharing the site with the dumbbell species (negative permission).

# For dumbbell calculations, it is necessary to use the BULKSPECIES keyword, to let the code know that a pure dumbbell with given coordinates (e.g. [d, d, 0]) is identical to a dumbbell with opposite coordinates (e.g. [-d, -d, 0]), so it must not be counted twice. When not using this keyword, a special definition of the jump mechanisms is necessary, and the computed partition function is wrong. See user guide for more information. 
& BULKSPECIES 1					# The special symmetry rule applies to species '1' (the dumbbell) 

# Definition of jump mechanisms, by initial and final position of all atoms defining the jump (use species 0 to indicate bulk atoms, i.e. sites that should not be occupied by defects or solutes)
# A pure dumbbell is marked by giving the coordinates of either one of the two dumbbell atoms. A mixed dumbbell is described by two species: the dumbbell in the position of the bulk atom (e.g. [d, d, 0]), and the solute in the opposite position (e.g. [-d, -d, 0]). 
# Note that the same dumbbell site (e.g. [d,d,0]) cannot be occupied by a dumbbell and a solute at the same time. 
# A solute-solute dumbbell is described by two solute species explicitly occupying [d,d,0] and [-d,-d,0] 
# Do not put bulk atoms (species 0) in a pure dumbbell, because by default a dumbbell species contains only bulk atoms unless one or more solutes are on that site. Bulk atoms can be only on the substitutional lattice.
